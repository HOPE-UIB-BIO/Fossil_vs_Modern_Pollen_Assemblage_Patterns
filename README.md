## Repo description
This repository contains data and R codes for analysing concordance of spatial patterns in pollen assemblage properties revealed by recent (50-500 years) fossil pollen assemblages and surface pollen assemblages of angiosperms compiled from central Asia.

## How to access the repo?
"Fossil_vs_Modern_Pollen_Assemblage_Patterns" ('R project' from here on) is accessible in two ways:
1. If a user has a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), the easiest way is to create your own GitHub repo using this [Github link](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/Fossil_vs_Modern_Pollen_Assemblage_Patterns)
2. A user can download the latest Release of the R project as a zip file from the "Fossil_vs_Modern_Pollen_Assemblage_Patterns" [Release page]()
